      <h2>Free!</h2>
      <h5><em>Why 'Free' is price-point and NOT a service offering</em> - <strong>August 28, 2020</strong></h5>
      <div class="headerImg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>Free..</p>
      <p>Who doesn't like 'Free'?  Some would say that the best things in life are free.  The 'intangibles' like self-confidence, love, respect of peers... these things 
        (should) come without a monetary attachment.  But what about services and goods?  Rarely do free services and goods stack up to their paid counter-offers, and rarely are we 'blown away' by what is offered for free.</p>
      <p>We are constantly being offered 'Free Services', but what does that actually mean, and how can we best determine when free is 'good enough'?  Three common offerings come to mind: 
        'Free Delivery', 'Free Wi-Fi', and <a href="https://zoom.us/" title="Zoom.com">Zoom's</a> 'Free' basic tier.  Each one serves a purpose, and each one has certain reasons why it is free.</p>
        <p><div class="artImg1"></div></p>
      <p>Let's start with Free Delivery.  Whether it is a restaraunt/carry-out or a vendor shipping product, free delivery is always a welcome site.  It's 'Free' because it is simply a delivery method for something you are paying for.  So, we need to think of this as delivery cost 'included' in what we already agreed to pay.  
        The cost of the food in a restaurant is rarely more expensive per item if you have it delivered vs picking it up in person.  The restaraunt is NOT selling you delivery, thy are selling you food and beverage.  Enter <a href="https://www.grubhub.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=National+%7C+All+%7C+Brand&utm_term=grubhub&efkwid=4961869853&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1qL6BRCmARIsADV9JtYfmV0rCU0N3XoeEZYngeIjoRfjys5IHYVzAh6voxrZvv3GP7DrNWoaAnpeEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" title="grubhub.com">GrubHub</a> and <a href="https://www.doordash.com/en-US" title="DoorDash">DoorDash</a>, as well as many other local and regional services.
        They have insterted themselves into the market with the sole purpose of DELIVERING YOU FOOD FOR A FEE.  These types of services are offering you Delivery as a SERVICE... not as a free add-on.
        They are successful (even before stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures were in place) because they offer delivery from establishments that may not have offered door-to-door delivery in the past.  Upscale establishments, carry-outs, coffee shops... all can be found on such services, and all have a cost.  they are not free, but we use these services due to their OFFERING and NOT their PRICE.
      </p>
      <p>OK, now that you have all placed your GrubHub orders, let's try and wrap this up before the doorbell rings...</p>
      <p>Let's move on to 'Free Wi-Fi'.  Today, in 2020, access to information is paramount to our daily tasks.  Connecting to 'the internet' or a network wirelessly from almost anywhere is a huge advancement in technology and productivity.  Furthermore, advances in cellular/mobile network speeds and access have literally put the entire digital world within a device that fits in a pocket and can be used/taken anywhere.</p>
      <p>But, let's jump back a few years to 2010.  Yes there was still celluar data plans, but these were often expensive, and offered at additional cost or with limitations.  Watching a video on YouTube could actually cost you money, if you weren't careful.  But that was OK, because places like coffee shops, hotels, restaraunts and libraries offered Free Wi-Fi (usually only for customers).  
        This was great for the freelancer who wanted an inspiring place to work with free decent internet access.  It was also a lifesaver for the student in a non-broadband-internet household, or the traveler who needed to access their email while traveling for business.  These places could offer free wi-fi because they were either:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>Selling you something</li>
          <li>Paid by a benefactor or public program to provide the wifi to a community</li>
          or
          <li>Their customers/clientelle 'expected' it</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      
      <p>As the capabilites of networks and devices expanded, the demands on wi-fi networks began to show their cracks.  Initially, wi-fi speeds, even at the lowest tiers, would outperform cellular networks by a long-shot.  Then, as cellular network speed improved, and unlimited data plans became the norm, free wi-fi often was lacking in user experience.
        Fast forward to today- internet speeds continue to improve, as did our productivity.  Getting the internet on your phone is great, but I have a laptop connected to a work intranet, streaming music on another device, and trying to share funny videos to colleagues (I'm actually doing NONE of those things at the moment).  Cellular data on a phone doesn't cut it.  So,
        re-enter the world of free wi-fi.  More and more, internet access is being seen more as a utility and basic need, rather than a luxury.  So, 'Free Wi-Fi' is still here, but usually it is 'walled off' network, with serious limits on speed, access, and even content.  But fear not!  There is almost ALWAYS a way to pay for faster/more robust wi-fi.  So, in this case, 'Free' is a 'lure', a service that is offered, but only as a base to available faster networks.
      </p>
      <p><div class="artImg2"></div></p>
      <p>Zoom is a similar case.  Their basic, free tier offeres almost all of the functionality of their paid tiers, but has a TIME LIMIT on the length of meetings (40 minutes).  Why 40 minutes?  It's genius!  40 minutes is ALMOST enough time for MOST meetings (scheduled in 1-hour blocks), but usually falls short.  It doesn't take too many starts/stops of the same meeting before any productive professional realizes this is not the best option.  Zoom is providing some awesome productivity tools for a very reasonable price, that scale to your needs.  Their business is built on the needs of Enterprise clients and paid users, while still allowing others to use the service for free, with limitations.</p>
      <p>So, as the delivery driver makes their way to my door with lunch, I'll wrap it up.  Free is great.  Free, as a price point, is a great incentive.  It is also really good at explaining why PAID versions of their service exist.  Sometimes free is perfect for the job, and sometimes it is far from adequate.  Understand WHAT your needs and expecations are from the service, and make the best determination of what will work best.  And, if that seems daunting to you, reach out to the service provider.  If it is something you need, and you TRUST the vendor/provider, then use their experience and consider their recommendations.  As a Sales Professional, it's frustrating to see clients mis-spend time to save some money.  Personally, my reputation and gained respect mean WAY more to me than getting a few more dollars on the order.  I am here as a CONSULTANT and EXPERT RESOURCE, and encourage my clients to use me in that regard... for FREE.  What's MY ulterior motive?  I want you to be successful and spend your time and resources wisely.  
        Why?  Because an educated customer or client makes the best decisions.</p>
